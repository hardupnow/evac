Ensemble Verification and Creation. An evolution of my WEM package.

NOT TESTED YET - still refactoring WEM.

As a sidenote, I encourage all users of Python to cite packages and acknowledge fellow
users in publications and presentations. There is often little incentive for
researchers to open source their efforts, yet it is a process that needs
to be encouraged.

Where do I start?
=================

Documentation incoming. For now, check out the READMEs and in-line
commenting.

## TO DO
* Folder naming - should it clash with scripts within the directories?
